The average travel time for these spacecraft is a total of 237 days. The amazing thing is, however, that this is on top of the two year wait for each ideal launch window as the two planetary orbits come into sync allowing for the shortest possible flight. We here at the Martian Tribune would like to thank our wise leaders and planners for their provision as with nearly two years between possible launch windows, the margin for error is small indeed."}
