It is theorized that Mars once had an internal dynamo, as Earth does now, which previously protected the planet from such space debris. Once that shut down all that now remains are just how many rocks were magnetized, and how strongly. Thankfully, in this location, we have one of those smaller, local magnetospheres serving as an invisible protector on top of the security provided by each of our domes."}
