9013533,"Fuel of the Future",
9013534,"     Researchers have recently completed designs for the construction of Martian Fuel Refineries and the Polymer Factories using only drones and parts found on the surface of Mars. This is a huge breakthrough in Martian engineering as before this point all fuel refineries and polymer factories had to be imported as fully built structures from Earth, an expensive and time consuming process that may now be bypassed thanks to their hard work and diligence.",
9013535,"Drones Imbued With the Secrets of Hydrosynthesis",
9013536,"     Martian Drones have recently been given the plans for fuel refinery and polymer factory construction, which up until now was a closely guarded secret from <MTSponsor>. This advancement will let us create both fuel and polymers, without any support from Earth, requiring only locally sourced water.",
9013537,"Drones Reminded That Structure Shells Look Silly",
9013538,"     Drones on Mars Have received a software upgrade that reminds them that leaving the shell of a former structure looks messy, unkept and serves no purpose, thus it is ok for them to remove the shell and make the surface look nice again.  We simply have to say ""please"", is all.",
9013539,"Decommissioning Buildings Necessary for Colonial Advancement",
9013540,"     <MTSponsor> has announced that some of the buildings made on Mars may need to not only be salvaged but entirely decommissioned and destroyed in order to pave the way for future construction. Drones have now been updated with the necessary tools to perform this function whenever instructed. Please be purposeful in making such requests.  All requests to decommission Spacebars will automatically be refused.",
9013541,"Rockets Now Made More Spacious",
9013542,"     Scientists have discovered a way to fit up to 10,000kg more junk food and supplies in each rocket sent to Mars. By squeezing the fuel into a smaller tank, they have created more cargo space. ""It's amazing we didn't think of this earlier, just make the fuel tank smaller.  It might pertain to rockets, but it is definitely not rocket science"".",
9013543,"Looser Safety Restrictions Means More Room For Cargo",
9013544,"     Claiming to employ new, improved Kerbal construction methods, <MTSponsor> has taken the liberty of removing nearly all of the safety features from our Mars-bound rockets, replacing them instead with a healthy supply of MK16 Parachutes.  This one, relatively minor change allows us to fit 10,000kg more cargo in the Ship and should keep colonists safe in their travels regardless.  Hopefully.",
9013545,"Water Recovery Explained",
9013546,"     We recently sat down for an interview with <MTScientist> where we learned what lead to the new Water Reclamation technology: ""Well basically, we realised that the dome is very similar in design to a water purifier on Earth, except that it's missing the cup in the middle to collect all the water. That's what this new spire will do. It will collect the condensation from the dome's interior and convert it back into consumable water for the inhabitants, effectively cutting our water usage in half.""",
9013547,"New Spire Does NOT Contain Swimming Pool",
9013548,"     Despite many requests, and the far reaching rumors about Project Whirlpool. It has been revealed that the recent spire design will not contain a swimming pool, but is instead a system for reclaiming water inside a dome and preparing it for re-use. Personally, while there is clear value in the end result, I think a pool would be far more fun.",

9013550,"Painting Water Vaporators",
9013551,"     Scientists have recently discovered that painting water vaporators with Hygroscopic Paint actually has the effect of increasing water output.  In celebration, the Martian Tribune would like to announce the First Annual Vaporator Graffiti Contest!  Grab your paint brushes and let's see those designs!  The top five entries, voted on by you, our faithful readers, will become the new designs for all future vaporators!",
9013552,"Successful Martian Colony Brings Hope",
9013553,"     Our beautiful Martian colony, that started many sol ago has brought hope to humanity, inspiring her to look beyond, unto other planets, with a desire to colonise other rocks within the Milky Way. Most of the impetus at the moment are for colonisation of the moon, Europa, Venus and Jupiter.  Russia has stated that it would consider trying to colonise Pluto, though this was before realising Russia is already bigger than the icy dwarf planet.",

9013555,"     Nope, it's a 2018 Tesla Roadster.  The car was originally hurled into space by the eccentric billionaire Elon Musk through his now famous spacefaring organization, Space X.  The Roadster is just now passing Mars in an eliptical orbit before continuing on its course back toward low Earth orbit.  Without this groundbreaking Roadster, we may not be where we are today.  Be sure to look up and thank the cars that we made it here safely!",
9013556,"But How Do They Work?",
9013557,"     Our Martian Moxies will now be able to put magnets into their filtration chambers in order to create more oxygen. We don't fully understand how, and when a scientist explained it to us, we fell asleep about 45 minutes in. Nonetheless, they assure us that it works as intended, but that we may need to take some iron supplements to enhance the effects to desired levels.",
9013558,"Moxie Magnets Make Magic",
9013559,"     Scientists Have developed a novel magnetic attachment for the Moxie. The attachment filters out far more of the tiny metals floating in the Martian atmosphere than previously thought possible.  This new filtration technique allows the Moxie to more effectively create that life saving oxygen that we so desperately need.",
9013560,"People With Mushroom Allergies Beware",
9013561,"     We have recently discovered the secret to growing mushrooms on Mars. It wasn't really too complicated as Mushrooms can grow just about anywhere, but now we can farm them. If you have a mushroom allergy, we recommend taking one of the next shuttles to Earth, as a new Martian staple has been added to the menu.",
9013562,"Mushrooms on Mars",
9013563,"     Researchers have designed a new building that can be placed outside of a dome. It will be its own self-contained farm and will grow a specialized Martian Mushroom. It should be noted these specialized mushrooms are illegal on Earth, and should never be brought back when traveling back to the blue planet.",
9013564,"Adding Waste To The Dust Makes Soil",
9013565,"     Scientists have discovered that adding human waste to a water and dust mixture can create a viable soil for arable farming.  Botanists have immediately begun working with dome architects to create designs for the first Martian Farms that do not require electricity and might reduce our reliance on hydroponics.",
9013566,"Botanists Rejoice As Farming Becomes Viable",
9013567,"     It was once thought that the only possible way to make food on Mars would be with a significant number of hydroponic farms, but after many sol of rigorous research, it has been found that we can indeed make normal flat Farms inside our domes. Numerous botonists have betrayed their irrational fear of heights and urged the use of these new farms as soon as possible.",
9013568,"The Martian Games",
9013569,"     Following The Failed bid to host the olympics on Mars, <MTLeader> has decided to create our own games, incorporating Blackjack and Hoopers, among others. Games of Hoopers will start things off this coming Saturday in the open air gym. Also considered for the Martian Games are Dome Skiing, where contestants race down the outside of a dome on pallets, and Drone Jumping.",

9013574,"They're Fighting, Stop Fighting!",
9013575,"     Local outspoken dome inhabitant, <MTRenegade> was caught instigating several fights this weekend.  Rumor has it that he was trying to build interest in a club.  After sobering up overnight, the renegade was quoted as saying, ""What club? There is no club.""",

In consultation with local security, an attorney on retainer, and an unnamed source, we have come to the conclusion that it would be better were we not to talk about the aforementioned ""club"".",
9013580,"The Faith of Mars",
9013581,"     Religion has become a very important part of Martian life, ever since our first founders, who melded together all forms of Christiandom, Islam and Judaism into a single super faith. Today, there are a wide variety of religions on Mars: The True Humanity Society, who follow the teachings of Earth and worship her children, The Jedi, who follow the teachings of a galaxy far far away, The aforementioned Tri-Faith, which follows the teachings of each of the above Earthling faiths, and of course, our very own Red Church of Mars, which needs no explanation.",
9013582,"Guru In The Garden",
9013583,"     Martian Guru <MTGuru> has informed the Martian Tribune that they will be holding frequent meditation and contemplation sesions in the dome's garden. ""The garden is the natural spot for gurus like me, it lets me reach a more intense inner core, and connect more deeply with others and with nature.""",

9013587,"A Martian Marathon",
9013588,"     Mars' first RC Explorer has now traversed a whopping 42.2 Kilometers, or 26.2 miles, completing its own personal marathon on Mars. We at the Martian Tribune support this great explorer in its marathon effort. May the discoveries continue to pour in as a result of such diligence and dedication.",
9013589,"<MTDrone1> Breakdown",
9013590,"     <MTDrone1> suffered a minor fault to its front left wheel yesterday causing the drone to be unable to complete tasks for the sol. The lucky drone had friends, however, namely <MTDrone2> who noticed <MTDrone1> struggling and helped to repair their wheel before sol's end.",
9013591,"Shuttle Capacity Doubled",
9013592,"     Researchers have discovered that it is possible to add up to ten more seats to our passenger shuttles, allowing up to 22 new colonists to come to Mars at once! This new discovery was made when a researcher knocked his chair over, causing him to realise that there is no up or down in space, so we could simply add more seats to the ""ceiling"" of the previous design.",
9013593,"A Clinic on Inefficiency",
9013594,"     Attending a clinic is often a place to learn, unless you're <MTLeaderTitle> <MTLeader>.  Apparently it's expected that resources will move themselves and planning is just plain overrated.  <MTLeaderTitle>, we need more drones and we need them yesterday!  I only hope that everyone receives their food and other essential supplies in time.",
9013595,"Word of the Day:  Power Conservation",
9013596,"     Leadership has declared it a non-issue, but the flickering lights are not your imagination: our power infrastructure is failing us and no longer meets the burgeoning demands of our colony.  Please remember to turn off all lights and electronics when not in use.  Your neighbors will thank you for it.",
9013597,"Power Grid Depleted",
9013598,"     If it feels a little colder in your dome today than yesterday, that may be because our power grid is maxed and the <MTLeaderTitle> seems to be doing nothing about it.  Dress warmly, this isn't the first day the power's gone out and it likely won't be the last.",

9013616,"Oval Dome Declared Unnatural",
9013617,"     The building of the new Oval Dome has stirred a fair share of controversy on Mars. The Flat Mars League (FML) has come forward, claiming it unnatural.
